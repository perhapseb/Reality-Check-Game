# Reality-Check-Game
NMA 322

Sat, Nov 22: The first version is up of the game! Make sure the dialog uploaded is matching the same name ("dialog.twee"). Any dialog should work now when uploaded and committed, when art is finished for the backgrounds and characters we can get rid of the blank squares 😭
For writing dialog. Make sure each dialog starts with the characters name followed by a colon (Ex. Olivia:). This is so we can change the image to match who we are talking to.

You can test the game out on the Github Page:
